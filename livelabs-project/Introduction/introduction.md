# Generating tasks list for labeling PDF files

## Introduction 
In machine learning, data labeling is the process of identifying and tagging raw data—such as images, text, or video—with meaningful labels that help models learn. These labels act as the "answers" or "ground truth" during training, allowing the model to learn how to recognize patterns or make predictions.

In this workshop we will walk you through the process of using Label Studio to label data to be then used to train custom AI models within OCI.

Note: If you face any issues during setup and installation, please refer to the 'common issues' section towards the end.

***Estimated Lab Time*** 90 minutes


### Objectives:
In this workshop you will learn how to: 
* Install and run Label studio.
* Convert PDF documents into a format supported by Label Studio to enable labeling
* Setup OCI OCR backend for pre-annotation
* Export labelled files from Label Studio
* Create a bucket in OCI and upload the labelled files to it.
* Train a custom model on this data


### Prerequisites (Optional)
* An Oracle Free Tier, or Paid Cloud Account
* Additional prerequisites (cloud services) are mentioned per lab
* Familiar with OCI Policy and SDK/CLI setup.
* Familiar with Python/Java programming for SDK usage is strongly recommended.


You may now **proceed to the next lab**
